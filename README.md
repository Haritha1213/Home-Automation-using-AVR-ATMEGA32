# Home-Automation-using-AVR-ATMEGA32
Home automation refers to the automatic control of various home systems and appliances using sensors or IoT without manual operation. This project interfaces IR sensor and temperature sensor with AVR atmega32 microcontroller to control varioushome appliances. Not only it eliminates manual operation but also it reduces power consumption by turning off the appliances when human presence is not detected.
